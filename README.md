# Unnamed RPG Game - [Andrew Borondia](https://cranky-beaver-6bfa9c.netlify.app/projects)

This is a project I made as part of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of trades and Technology.

It is an RPG game built using C#, for the C# console. The requirements for the project were very basic, but I have added many extra features.
